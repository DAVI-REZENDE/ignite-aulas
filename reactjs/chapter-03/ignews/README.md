# Ignews
In this project I learned how to social login with Github, I learned how to use Next.js to your routing system, I learned how to use the stripe api to make payment within the application, I learned the server side render (SSR) and static site generator methods (SSG) with next, I learned to display the content of posts only to the user who signed the application, I used CMS Prismic and consumed its api to write the posts. All this in this project developed in the Rocketseat course!

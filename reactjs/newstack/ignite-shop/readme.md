# Ignite Shop

Ignite Shop is an e-commerce that sells rocketseat shirts, where Next.js was used to make Static Site Generation (SSG) to render the main screen and the product screen and Server Side Rendering (SSR) to render the success, to purchase the t-shirts I used the stripe API

> Attention: for the purchase of shirts, use the card with the number 4242 4242 4242 424, and a date greater than the current day
